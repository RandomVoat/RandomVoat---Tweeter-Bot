I came across an old script I was using for a bot that would tweet randomly selected lines from a local .txt file, which I was dumping/scraping sentences into. 
I had some free time today and decided to re-purpose the script to keep me busy/for the hell of it. 
After adjusting some code and making some alterations to a ruby script a friend of mine wrote for scraping reddit, I pulled everything over to one of my Raspberry Pi's and set up a cron job to run the python and web scraper scripts at the top of every hour. 
I then set up the Tweeter account and created/authorized the app to said account. Thus, RandomVoat was born.
